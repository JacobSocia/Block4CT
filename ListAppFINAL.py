"""
addToList()
Function explanation: this function uses newItem = input("Please type an integer!   ")
and once you type an integer it adds it to the list using append then it prints the list
"""

    newItem = input("Please type an integer!  ")

"""
addABunch()
Function explanation: this function makes a huge list by asking how many integers you want and then how high those integers can go
then it just adds all of those numbers into a list
"""

    print("Your list is now complete!")

"""
sortList(myList)
Function explanation: takes myList and sorts it and puts it into unique_List after its sorts it asks if you want to see the list and then you can respond in Y or N and it
prints it if you say Y
"""
def sortList(myList):
    for x in myList:

printLists()
Function explanation: this function takes unique_List and takes the length of it and it later asks you if you want it sorted or unsorted
"""

"""
indexValues()
function explanation: this function says the input of indexPos it uses that and turns it unto an integer that later is added to myList
"""
def indexValues():
    indexPos = input("At what index position would you like to look?  ")
    print(myList[int(indexPos)])
"""
randomSearch()
Function explanation: this random search uses the random.randint to put a random integer from the lost then it prints it
"""
def randomSearch():
    print("Here's a random value from your list!")
    print(myList[random.randint(0, len(myList)-1)])

linearSearch()
function explanation: it searchs the number you want it to search and gives it back to you and what position its at but this is the slowest way to search for an integer

"""
recursiveBinarySearch()
function explanation: this function takes the sorted list splits it in half searchs the 2 lists to see if it has that number and deletes the list without it this continues to happen until
it comes up with 1 integer
"""
def recursiveBinarySearch(unique_List, low, high, x):

"""
interoveBinarySearch(unique_List)
function explanation: this function works just like the recursiveBinarySearch but instead of it being recursive it is interove
"""
