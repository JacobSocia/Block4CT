Section 1
-----------
Step 1 - Download python file and run the code
Step 2 - Once you run the code it asks you how many integers you want to add and you type in an integer
Step 3 - then it asks you "And how high would you like these numbers to go?" and you type in another integer
Step 4 - after that it gives you 8 options you can do all different functions
Step 5 - choose one of the functions and continue to sort your list in different ways

Section 2
-----------
RecursiveBinarySearch = this function takes the sorted list splits it in half searchs the 2 lists to see if it has that number and deletes the list without it this continues to happen until
it comes up with 1 integer
InteriveBinarySearch = this function is alot like the RecursiveBinarySearch but it searches through the high and low values and returns the mid point

Section 3
-----------
I changed up the menus of the program because I thought that it felt clunky and confusing the way I changed it was by renaming the mainprogram function to programStart
and made it so at the very begining it asks you to make a list out of integers and then once that list is created it lets you choose which function you want to use on the
list.
